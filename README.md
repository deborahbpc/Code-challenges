# Code Challenges (and interview questions)

This repo was created as a device for me to keep track of code challenges I solved in different languages while studying.
It can also work as a piece of portfolio, so my code and logic can be seen for whoever might be interested.
Last but not least, it can be a code challenge database for those willing to study as well.

## Structure

Although the way I organize the challenges might change through time, I'll always try to make these items present:

* Where I got the challenge from.
* Description of the problem and desired solution.
* Reasoning behind my chosen path.

For more complex challenges, when applicable, I'll also try to add:

* Trade-offs I might have made
* Things I left out
* Things I would make differently if I were to spend more time on it
* Link to the hosted solution

## Considerations
* I'm not claiming to have the best answers. They're just the ones I found by the time i tried the challenge
* Sometimes I'll try to complete the same challenge with different languages (according to what I'm trying to learn)
* Feel free to clone this repo and make your own solutions
* Feel free to comment on solutions or suggest new challenges(my contacts are below)
